This blog is to document some of the interesting things one can do with computers (special emphasis on OSX).
Our focus here is to learn how OSX works, how to develop apps in for OSX, how people attack OSX, and how we can defend, and identify attacks against OSX.

However, every now and then, we will explore topics that are not Apple-specific.
